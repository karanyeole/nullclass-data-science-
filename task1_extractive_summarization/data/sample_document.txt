Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data and improve over time. Deep learning, a further subset, uses neural networks to analyze complex patterns. AI applications include natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These technologies are used in healthcare for diagnostics, in finance for fraud detection, and in automotive for self-driving cars. Challenges include ethical concerns, data privacy, and the need for large datasets. AI has the potential to revolutionize our world, but careful implementation is crucial.
